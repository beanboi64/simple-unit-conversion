Simple Unit Conversion (SUC) is a beginner-friendly Python command-line tool that converts between common units such as temperature, distance, weight, length, and volume. It features a menu-driven interface and uses functions for each conversion, showcasing foundational Python skills like conditionals and return statements. Currently, it does not handle non-numeric inputs, which will be improved in future updates.
